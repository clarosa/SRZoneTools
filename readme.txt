Zone File Tools for Saints Row by Quantum at saintsrowmods.com
Supports Saints Row: The Third and Saints Row IV.

This package contains Windows command-line tools that can be used to work with
zone files (*.czh_pc and *.czn_pc).  This assumes you have some familiarity
with the Windows command line.

INSTALLATION

  Nothing needs to be installed.  Just put the ".exe" files somewhere in your
  PATH and run them.

TOOLS

  SRReadZone.exe      Parses and displays the contents of a zone header file
                      and the corresponding zone data file.  Type the command
                      with no parameters to display a usage message.
  
  SRZoneTool.exe      Converts zone files to and from XML format.  Type the
                      command with no parameters to display a usage message.
                      For more information about this tool, see the
                      "SRZoneTool.html" document included in this package.

  SRZoneFinder.exe    Finds zone files closest to a set of coordinates.
                      Type the command with no parameters to display a usage
                      message.

  SRPatchFile.exe     Writes one or more bytes to specific locations in an
                      existing file.  Great for scripting!
