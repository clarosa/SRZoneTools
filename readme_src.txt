SRZoneTools - Saints Row Zone File Tools
Copyright (c) 2015 by Christopher LaRosa.  All rights reserved.

Supports Saints Row: The Third, Saints Row 4, and Saints Row: Gat Out Of Hell.

This package contains the Visual C# source code for the SRZoneTools package.
It can be built using Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop.
The actual executable code is distributed in a separate package.

A word of warning:  This code for the SRReadZone tool is ugly.  VERY ugly!
It was written as an experiment to parse the zone files, so it's quite a hack.
For more information on the Zone File format, see this topic:

Code in any ThirdParty directories is not written by me.
For information on those files, read the copyright information in the files.
